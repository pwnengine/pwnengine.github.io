rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Exploit.edu Heap Zero - Heap Hell</a>Last walkthrough showed how to overflow the heap until a chunk that contained a function pointer was overwritten the address of the winner() function. In this walkthrough I'll explain my thought process and methodology as well, but first let's get into some stuff I believe I should have covered the first time.<br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20250804112424.png\" src=\"pasted-image-20250804112424.png\" target=\"_self\">\nThis is a visual representation of the binaries we will be hacking. Please note that the top left \"writable; not executable\" is not always the case as it depends on compiler protections (ours is since we use execstack when compiling). That's a bit off topic for the stack, but I want to show how the stack will grow \"down\" and the heap will grow \"up\". In theory you could smash right through the stack from the heap with 0x41 aka As for example. This would definitely break the program, still possible though without if buffer size isn't checked correctly.<br>Just like before I'll start by grabbing the code without looking at it (or trying not to). That way I can use Ghidra and start from a binary. I'll use the script <a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://github.com/pwnengine/binary-exploitation-ctf-helpers\" target=\"_self\">https://github.com/pwnengine/binary-exploitation-ctf-helpers</a> gcc-no-protect64.sh to compile without protections. You could just grab the binary from that repository and not compile at all. I'll open Ghidra on the binary and take a look.<br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20250806112119.png\" src=\"pasted-image-20250806112119.png\" target=\"_self\">At main I can see that it's looking a bit strange. When I see variables like this it's safe to assume it could be a struct. It's just something you notice while doing CTFs like this, or even reversing in general.<br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20250806113332.png\" src=\"pasted-image-20250806113332.png\" target=\"_self\">This is the decompiled code after I changed the two unidentified types to structs. I also changed the size representation to decimal (16 bytes) and the labels (struct1, struct2). I'm confident this is similar to what we'd see when viewing the source code. Now that there's a better representation what's going on here? Well, struct1 is allocated and it's first field is assigned 1 then another allocation is created on the heap with a size of 8 bytes. A second field of the struct is assigned to the memory address of the 8 byte allocation. The exact same thing happens with struct2 the difference is it's first field is 2 not 1. From this I can get an idea of what the author wants us to do. The first strcpy() will NOT check size of buffer so we could write to it until we've overwritten the field that is getting dereferenced in the second strcpy(). If we overwrite it to another address when that second strcpy() is called anything in the second command-line argument will be written to it. I want to show the original code now before we start debugging with PwnDBG:<br>\n<img alt=\"Pasted image 20250806114529.png\" src=\"pasted-image-20250806114529.png\" target=\"_self\">\nLooks like I was right about what the binary was doing. Let's proceed..<br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20250808092606.png\" src=\"pasted-image-20250808092606.png\" target=\"_self\">\nWe have a clear picture of what we want to accomplish. Let's run PwnDBG and get the functions.<br>\n<img alt=\"Pasted image 20250806115620.png\" src=\"pasted-image-20250806115620.png\" target=\"_self\">\nI'll grab the address for winner() as that's where we want to end up. Next, disassemble main() and set a breakpoint somewhere that makes sense to calculate the padding needed for the payload.<br>\n<img alt=\"Pasted image 20250806115757.png\" src=\"pasted-image-20250806115757.png\" target=\"_self\">\nmain+20 is where the first malloc() is called so I'll break there and get the RAX register for the address returned. I'll also set a breakpoint at main+160 the last strcpy to examine the allocated chunks after being filled.Next just run the program r AAAAAAAA BBBBBBBB.<br>\n<img alt=\"Pasted image 20250806205302.png\" src=\"pasted-image-20250806205302.png\" target=\"_self\">Take note of RAX that's the address returned by malloc().c then on the next break ni and examine the memory at the address noted down from above using x/128x 0x405310.<br>\n<img alt=\"Pasted image 20250806205915.png\" src=\"pasted-image-20250806205915.png\" target=\"_self\">\nThe 41s are the As from the first command-line argument and as you can guess the 42s are the Bs. At this point let's go over the attack:\nWe overflow with A/41 as padding until we're about to overwrite the value 0x00405370 with the first command-line argument.\nWe then append the address the GOT puts() entry, still in the first command-line argument.\nThe first strcpy() will write the first command-line argument which will overwrite the second struct, specifically the pointer to 0x405370.\nSince the second strcpy() dereferences the the address whatever we put in the second command-line argument will overwrite the GOT entry for puts.\nWe overwrite it with the address to winner() and puts() is called before exit in the program redirecting flow to winner.\nCounting how many bytes it would take right before overwriting 0x00405370 from 0x00405330 we get 40 bytes. We can use readelf -all heap1 | grep puts to get the address of the puts GOT address. Putting that all together the final payload is:r $(python2 -c \"print('A'*40 + '\\x08\\x40\\x40')\") $(python2 -c \"print('\\x21\\x12\\x40')\")\n<br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20250807161616.png\" src=\"pasted-image-20250807161616.png\" target=\"_self\"><br>\n<img alt=\"Pasted image 20250808092738.png\" src=\"pasted-image-20250808092738.png\" target=\"_self\">\nThe second heap exercise is complete!","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Previous","level":2,"id":"Previous_0"},{"heading":"Continued","level":2,"id":"Continued_0"},{"heading":"Heap vs Stack","level":2,"id":"Heap_vs_Stack_0"},{"heading":"Ghidra","level":2,"id":"Ghidra_0"},{"heading":"Hacking The Mainframe","level":2,"id":"Hacking_The_Mainframe_0"}],"links":["exploit.edu-heap-zero-heap-hell.html#_0"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"exploit.edu-heap-one-heap-hell-part-two.html","pathToRoot":".","attachments":["pasted-image-20250804112424.png","pasted-image-20250806112119.png","pasted-image-20250806113332.png","pasted-image-20250806114529.png","pasted-image-20250808092606.png","pasted-image-20250806115620.png","pasted-image-20250806115757.png","pasted-image-20250806205302.png","pasted-image-20250806205915.png","pasted-image-20250807161616.png","pasted-image-20250808092738.png"],"createdTime":1754331473968,"modifiedTime":1754670576840,"sourceSize":5130,"sourcePath":"Exploit.edu Heap One - Heap Hell Part Two.md","exportPath":"exploit.edu-heap-one-heap-hell-part-two.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":["pwn's-blog.html"],"type":"markdown"},"exploit.edu-heap-zero-heap-hell.html":{"title":"Exploit.edu Heap Zero - Heap Hell","icon":"","description":"This is my write-up for Heap Zero on <a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://exploit.edu.\" target=\"_self\">https://exploit.edu.</a> I'll be going over all of the heap ctfs with my process, thoughts, and tools used. Heap-based buffer overflows are often seen as an after thought in binary exploitation it seems when compared to stack-based overflows. I believe this may be because heap memory is not taught well. The stack is explained over and over, but where's the love for the heap. I want to note I'm not saying I'll explain it well, nor am I a great teacher. At the end of the day we're all learning/improving. Nevertheless, join me on this adventure into \"heap hell\".Okay, what even is the heap? Unlike the stack which you could called organized, heap memory is literally a \"heap\" of memory. Actually, it's a doubly linked list aka a tree. If we want to store something on the heap we call malloc() with the bytes we want and it will return a pointer to that address in memory. We can find very good information on malloc by being manly and using the man page.<br>\n<img alt=\"Pasted image 20250802234220.png\" src=\"pasted-image-20250802234220.png\" target=\"_self\"><br>\n<img alt=\"Pasted image 20250802234543.png\" src=\"pasted-image-20250802234543.png\" target=\"_self\"><br>The man page links to this article <a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://sourceware.org/glibc/wiki/MallocInternals\" target=\"_self\">https://sourceware.org/glibc/wiki/MallocInternals</a> on glibc's malloc which has great information, but mainly I want to highlight \"Glibc's malloc is chunk-oriented\" and \"Since all chunks are multiples of 8 bytes\". Lastly, It's important to get a view of a simple example of malloc:// The structure definition to contain metadata of each block\nstruct block{ size_t size; // Carries the size of the block int free;&nbsp;&nbsp; // metadata structure is free or not struct block* next; // Points to the next metadata block\n};\n<br>Let's go over the tools I'll be using. I will NOT be going over installing/setting up anything, but I will go over them and their functionality for the task. First, I should mention PwnDBG which is basically a plugin of sorts for GDB. You can learn more about PwnDBG here <a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://pwndbg.re/\" target=\"_self\">https://pwndbg.re/</a>. GDB is a debugger that may be already installed on your linux box. I probably don't need to explain GDB if you're reading this... Next is python 2 and python 3. Both versions will serve different purposes. Personally, I use python 2 for payloads through the terminal and python 3 for writing the actual exploit scripts. Occasionally, I'll use PwnTools, an exploitation python library <a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://docs.pwntools.com/en/stable/\" target=\"_self\">https://docs.pwntools.com/en/stable/</a> for easy payloads. Another useful tool is Ghidra <a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra\" target=\"_self\">https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra</a> for static analysis on the compiled binaries. The last tool(s) is not really needed, but it's a repo containing helping scripts for compiling without protection, disabling aslr <a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://github.com/pwnengine/binary-exploitation-ctf-helpers\" target=\"_self\">https://github.com/pwnengine/binary-exploitation-ctf-helpers</a>First, I'm going to grab the code from exploit.edu with my eyes closed. That sounds weird, but I prefer to not get a good look so I can figure out what's happening in Ghidra instead. I encourage this as it's more fun to start from a binary. If you go to my github you'll find a helping bash script to compile without protections, or just grab the binary from it if you wish. Import the binary into Ghidra and take a look...<br>\n<img alt=\"Pasted image 20250803001043.png\" src=\"pasted-image-20250803001043.png\" target=\"_self\">\nIt's a super simple program that just allocates two 64 byte chunks with malloc.<br>\n<img alt=\"Pasted image 20250803001435.png\" src=\"pasted-image-20250803001435.png\" target=\"_self\">\nI labeled the variables to better show the purpose. function_pointer will hold the address of nowinner payload_destination will be filled with the command line argument given to the binary\nwe write more than 64 bytes until we've overwritten function_pointer's data with another functions address\nThere's no length checking so this exploit is 100% possible. Now that we have a solid understanding on what we want to do it's hacking time.Technically it's printing out everything we need to do this without using PwnDBG, but it's too nice not to use. With info functions it shows a function called winner which we want the function pointer to point to instead of nowinner.<br>\n<img alt=\"Pasted image 20250803002619.png\" src=\"pasted-image-20250803002619.png\" target=\"_self\">\nUsually, when doing a stack-base buffer overflow you want to overwrite the instruction pointer and from there calculate how many bytes until you got there using the stack pointer. For this we're going to examine the memory and see how many bytes we need fill. <br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20250804082947.png\" src=\"pasted-image-20250804082947.png\" target=\"_self\">\nI just used a cyclic pattern of 70 to examine the memory space and see how much would be needed to overwrite the function address.

This is where our input will be copied into the buffer.<br>\n<img alt=\"Pasted image 20250804083518.png\" src=\"pasted-image-20250804083518.png\" target=\"_self\">If we run the program with run &lt;cyclic_pattern&gt; in PwnDBG using our cyclic pattern as input we can view the chunk of heap memory getting filled with it.

These apps are poorly written and you should never trust them to secure you, or your children's data. Would you believe me if I told you apps such as this are rarely used for parental control/monitoring? It's true! The actually audience for these apps are jealous partners and stalkers. For that reason moving forward I'll be referring to such apps as stalkerware.\n<img alt=\"Pasted image 20250722135454.png\" src=\"pasted-image-20250722135454.png\" target=\"_self\"><br>I decided to target <a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://phonsee.com\" target=\"_self\">https://phonsee.com</a> which after purchasing using a vulnerability to literally change the price turns out is just <a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://eyeszy.com.\" target=\"_self\">https://eyeszy.com.</a> Funny enough, these companies and <a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://parentaler.com\" target=\"_self\">https://parentaler.com</a> (which is seen referenced in the page source) are all subsidiaries of Fortunex Limited.

This was extremely easy since Phonsee is vulnerable to IDOR. I was able to purchase a license for just 69 cents.. nice...<br>\n<img alt=\"Pasted image 20250722141339.png\" src=\"pasted-image-20250722141339.png\" target=\"_self\"><br>\n<img alt=\"Pasted image 20250727124836.png\" src=\"pasted-image-20250727124836.png\" target=\"_self\">We can send a POST request with a discount of up to 99 to endpoint /backend/get-checkout and the server validates it. Then we can actually purchase it and well...<br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20250722142350.png\" src=\"pasted-image-20250722142350.png\" target=\"_self\">We have an Eyezy account with premium. If you remember from earlier these are are the same companies. The first thing I did was explore the dashboard and try to setup a device to monitor. I selected IOS and downloaded the Eyezy_setup.exe to a virtual machine to examine. In Ghidra I can see just from searching through the strings it's indeed an installation wizard which will install to the C drive. Confirming this I install the application and see it a new directory Eyezy in my C drive.<br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20250722143114.png\" src=\"pasted-image-20250722143114.png\" target=\"_self\">Visually I can tell it's a C# application right away. This means reversal will be simple with Dnspy. The first thing that draws my attention are api keys:if&nbsp;(this.AppState.AppBrand.ToLower()&nbsp;==&nbsp;\"eyezy\") {&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this.AppState.AmplitudeApiKey&nbsp;=&nbsp;\"2872c418988f2edc2172b32287a8c649\";&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n}&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nif&nbsp;(this.AppState.AppBrand.ToLower()&nbsp;==&nbsp;\"mstar\")&nbsp;{&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this.AppState.AmplitudeApiKey&nbsp;=&nbsp;\"9902da5576bd7f81dfcd05dcce8c21d9\";&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n}&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nif&nbsp;(this.AppState.AppBrand.ToLower()&nbsp;==&nbsp;\"spynger\")&nbsp;{&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this.AppState.AmplitudeApiKey&nbsp;=&nbsp;\"5fc821f6238efa3bd223e282420ccb7\";&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n}&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nthis.AppState.AmplitudeApiKey&nbsp;=&nbsp;\"9b29e1e272040be0053b1a0af59319cf\";\n<br>These are for analytics and have no value without the additional private key. The reason I'm showing this is because it seems <a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://mspy.mobi\" target=\"_self\">https://mspy.mobi</a> and <a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://spynger.net\" target=\"_self\">https://spynger.net</a> are both in the conspiracy. At this point I believe every parental monitoring app is just run by the same people. Actually, Spynger is completely advertised as stalkerware. They're site says it's \"Your Best Tool to Catch a Cheater\".Anyway, I found some endpoints while reverse engineering it: /api/v1/dc/sync/{0}/action-log\n/api/v1/auth/login\n/api/v1/auth/refresh-token\n/api/v1/auth/logout\n/api/v1/dc/win-client-version-latest\n/api/v1/dc/win-client-version-latest/download\n/api/v1/dc/osx-client-version-latest\n/api/v1/dc/osx-client-version-latest/download\n/api/v1/dc/sync/{0}/sensor-configs\n/api/v1/dc/sync/{0}/configs\n/api/v1/dc/desktop-log/upload\n/api/v1/dc/sync/{0}/add-device\n/api/v1/dc/device/{0}\n/api/v1/dc/sync/{0}/unlink-device\n/api/v1/dc/sync/{0}/unlink\n/api/v1/dc/device/{0}/init-backup\n/api/v1/dc/device/{0}/sensor-backups\n/api/v1/dc/sensor-backup/{0}/upload\n/api/v1/dc/sync\n/api/v1/dc/customer/syncs\n/api/v1/customer/subscriptions\n/api/doc\n/api/health-check/liveness\n/api/health-check/readiness\n/api/v1/slots/{0}/upload/start\n/api/v1/slots/{0}/upload/complete\n/api/v1/slots/{0}/sensors/data\nNext, I'd like to see the requests in action. To do this I'm going to route all the VMs traffic through burp proxy by listing on my host linux box and configuring it in Window's VM manual proxy settings.<br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20250722223417.png\" src=\"pasted-image-20250722223417.png\" target=\"_self\">There we go! The requests are being intercepted by burpsuite. Looking through them I can see they're matching what was expected from reversing the application. None of this looks very interesting to me...<br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20250722223551.png\" src=\"pasted-image-20250722223551.png\" target=\"_self\">Oh look, another bug of course. I took a peek at the /api/v1/auth/refresh-token POST request, which takes a refresh token as refreshToken in the body of the request and notice I could send the request multiple times and still get a new JWT &amp; refresh token returned back.<br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20250727124736.png\" src=\"pasted-image-20250727124736.png\" target=\"_self\"><br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20250727124753.png\" src=\"pasted-image-20250727124753.png\" target=\"_self\">Now we're looking at a Refresh Token Reuse Vulnerability. If an attacker obtains a refresh token, they can repeatedly use it to generate new JWTs, potentially gaining persistent access to the user’s account. I think it's safe to say security wasn't a top priority for the developer. I'm assuming more can be found, but I can't trigger any more requests to intercept without plugging in my phone (which I don't want to do for obvious reasons). I'll have to reverse the app deeper to see how the other endpoints are hit.I will be making a part two which will include a deeper analysis on the app itself to see exactly what it's doing behind the scenes. If you get anything out of reading this it should be these stalkerware applications do not have your security in mind and should never be trusted.First I want to see the core functionality of how the requests are made and to do this I'll use dotPeek which will let me export the decompiled app into a Visual Studio project for easier analysis.<br>\n<img alt=\"Pasted image 20250726165636.png\" src=\"pasted-image-20250726165636.png\" target=\"_self\">I created a reversed app that mimicked all the requests and played with them to see if anything interesting could be done. To make a long story short, a JWT had to be send with every request for the server to validate it and there aren't any secret keys of any sort. At this point I decided to take my attention off the desktop application and focus on the mobile one. I setup burpsuite proxy on my phone and started intercepting. Not to my surprise it's using Firebase, which is a popular Database as a Service (DBaaS) for mobile and web applications.<br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20250726170112.png\" src=\"pasted-image-20250726170112.png\" target=\"_self\"><br>A common technique to use against applications using Firebase is to check for a misconfiguration in rules that could let a threat actor read/write. For this I'll need to download the apk for analysis using <a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://apkpure.com.\" target=\"_self\">https://apkpure.com.</a> There's a great python tool for this called apkscan which will try to leak all secrets from the apk. You can clone it from github here <a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://github.com/LucasFaudman/apkscan\" target=\"_self\">https://github.com/LucasFaudman/apkscan</a>. Keep in mind it won't work with python 3.13 because it's importing re.TEMPLATE which is depreciated. I created a pull request removing the import, hopefully it gets accepted. If you want to use python 3.13 you'll need to remove line 7 of secret_scanner.py, or clone from my fork <a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://github.com/pwnengine/apkscan\" target=\"_self\">https://github.com/pwnengine/apkscan</a>. I was not able to retrieve any secrets, but it's still a good tool to have in the arsenal. My attention was then directed to /v2/parent/accounts which responds with all monitored devices data associated with the authToken. This token is a not a standard JWT and has no session binding. It's 32 bits and could be another point of interest considering burp's sequencer found the entropy to be poor. <br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20250727000948.png\" src=\"pasted-image-20250727000948.png\" target=\"_self\">Here's the problem, I wanted to check to see if tokens could be reused after another is issued and send this request with an empty deviceToken which crashed the server. Now, the app is completely unusable and I can't do much else. On the plus side this means there's a Denial of Service vulnerability here.<br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20250727001002.png\" src=\"pasted-image-20250727001002.png\" target=\"_self\"><br>\n<img alt=\"Pasted image 20250727001601.png\" src=\"pasted-image-20250727001601.png\" target=\"_self\">It's the next day and the api still returns a 502. I'm assuming that sending the request to /v2/parent/login without an empty deviceToken field caused an exception that was uncaught. So, we successfully took down the stalkerware. This wasn't how I wanted to end this, but that's all I got so far.

Actually, they completely remade their app (I think because of me). They even segmented their rewards and online casino into two different applications. This was probably a move to improve security after I disclosed the bugs. Anyway, I'd like to express the amount of difficulty it was to get in touch with someone at any of the companies involved. It was terrible...This started as a simple code review of a popular application by the casino/gas station company Terrible's. Their application is loved by many as it unlocks the ability to get free drinks when you fill up your tank. We all need gas, why not get free items with it? Well, the problem is this app like many today hire less real developers and supplement with the use of AI agents. We all know where that leads... So, let's dive right into the fumble of a multiple billion dollar oil/casino company's devops and as to why they decided to outsource their app's development to AI. Additionally, how this may lead to the downfall of other casinos in Las Vegas...I've been using this app to get free items because we all want free items, right? One day I was told of a policy change that limited the amount of free items which obviously was unfortunate. Because of this my curiosity told to look at the app and I decided to reverse engineer it.<img alt=\"Pasted image 20250816143600.png\" src=\"pasted-image-20250816143600.png\" target=\"_self\">How exactly does the app work? Like any hacker I'm interested in the inner workings of the things I interact with on a daily basis. I fire up the \"hacktop\" and get ready to sit through some vomits java code. Now, when I want to mess with an app my process generally remains the same:\n<br>Download the apk(s) from <a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://apkpure.com\" target=\"_self\">https://apkpure.com</a> onto my computer.\nUse jadx in some form to get java code out of said apk(s).\nLook for anything of interest to me.\n<br>Lately I've been using <a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF\" target=\"_self\">https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF</a> for the clean webapp interface.<br>\n<img alt=\"Pasted image 20250816144244.png\" src=\"pasted-image-20250816144244.png\" target=\"_self\">This is great as I can get a lot of information very quickly. It even performs some static code analysis for as well as finds potential secrets being leaked. But that's not how I found this god-awful vulnerability. I found it by looking at the URL's the app hits.<br>\n<img alt=\"Pasted image 20250816144618.png\" src=\"pasted-image-20250816144618.png\" target=\"_self\">\nI can see it uses DynamoDB which is Amazon's DBaaS and Twilio for presumably sending sms. Once I clicked on the source code file for registration I almost starting laughing.<br>\n<img alt=\"Pasted image 20250816144835.png\" src=\"pasted-image-20250816144835.png\" target=\"_self\">What you're seeing is the registration function that is called during signup which generates an OTP code on the client (don't ever do that). Usually when I see something so idiotic I feel the urge to keep looking harder because if that exists there's more.<br>\n<img alt=\"Pasted image 20250816145117.png\" src=\"pasted-image-20250816145117.png\" target=\"_self\">Then I realized the same thing was happening for signins... In theory this means I could signin to anyone's account without a password by using a OTP code that I am generating (well the app is generating). This is when we take a break and talk about the importance of NEVER TRUSTING THE CLIENT! With this information a threat actor could get into the account of every single user without a password just generating their own OTP codes and using them. The catch? There really isn't one you just need a number/email. Remember this is a multi-billion dollar casino and their app has in game slots where you can gamble. With a bug this bad I decided to go right into exploiting it. There's no way it works I'm thinking. I fire up burpsuite to intercept the requests from my phone and see if it's really sending over the otp to the server.<br>\n<img alt=\"Pasted image 20250816150154.png\" src=\"pasted-image-20250816150154.png\" target=\"_self\">This is the sign in screen. I started by putting my own number in to see if the OTP code I intercept is the same as the one I get send via sms.<br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20250826213523.png\" src=\"pasted-image-20250826213523.png\" target=\"_self\">That's the request with an OTP of 8126 let's remember this and let it go through.<br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20250816150537.png\" src=\"pasted-image-20250816150537.png\" target=\"_self\">That's the OTP meaning it's possible to capture it. Letting anyone with this knowledge to login to any account. One more thing, did you notice the last message? Yes, that's a custom message because you can edit the request to say anything you want. I tested this further by sending my girl friend a message:<br>\n<img alt=\"Pasted image 20250826213506.png\" src=\"pasted-image-20250826213506.png\" target=\"_self\">The potential for phishing with this is crazy! This left me wondering about the Authorization header in the request. <br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20250816151229.png\" src=\"pasted-image-20250816151229.png\" target=\"_self\"><br>\n<img alt=\"Pasted image 20250816151220.png\" src=\"pasted-image-20250816151220.png\" target=\"_self\">I looked through Twilio's website and found out they're leaking the Auth Token that could let me perform \"all account actions\". I'm not sure what this entails, let's find out, but first let's make sure everyone understands what I can do:\nI can log into anyone's account.\nI can send anyone messages from Terrible's number.\nI can perform every action on Terrible's Twilio Account.<br>\n<img alt=\"Pasted image 20250816151804.png\" src=\"pasted-image-20250816151804.png\" target=\"_self\">\nIf I were a threat actor this would be devastating for their company. I won't go into detail on all the terrible terrible things I could do to Terrible's laughs. Just use your imagination and you can think of the possibilities. Fortunately, I'm a good guy and will be responsibly reporting all of this.\nWhat is Twilio? Twilio is a cloud communications company which provides programmable communication tools for making and receiving phone calls, sending and receiving text messages, and performing other communication functions using its web service APIs. That's what Wikipedia says about twilio, but to see the functionality I have control over with the leaked auth token I checked their documentation.<br>\n<a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/requests-to-twilio\" target=\"_self\">https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/requests-to-twilio</a><br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20250816182652.png\" src=\"pasted-image-20250816182652.png\" target=\"_self\">The type of authentication the app is using is the second type. The one that says \"Limit your use to local testing\". This is where you face-palm while reading this.<br>\n<img alt=\"Pasted image 20250828212412.png\" src=\"pasted-image-20250828212412.png\" target=\"_self\">\nThis is definitely the account sid / auth token : separated when I base64 decode it.It keeps getting worse...<br>\n<img alt=\"Pasted image 20250816183504.png\" src=\"pasted-image-20250816183504.png\" target=\"_self\">\nThat's a screenshot from the documentation showing how to make a GET request to get all the messages sent. Keep in mind it's showing auth with apikey, but auth token (what I have) can do everything apikey can. If I were a threat actor I now have the first thing I would need to log into every account, or I now know every accounts number to launch a mass phishing campaign (I can still send messages from their number(s)). I could keep going on with the crazy things I could do, like get PII, but you get the point. Speaking about PII... Did you know that Terrible's stores your ID? Well they do.
